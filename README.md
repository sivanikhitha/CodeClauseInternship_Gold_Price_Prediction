Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Welcome to the Gold Price Prediction project repository. In this project, we explore the world of machine learning to predict gold prices using Python and Jupyter Notebook. We leverage a dataset sourced from Kaggle to build and train a predictive model that can forecast gold prices based on historical data.
Project Overview:
In this project, we delve into the field of machine learning to predict gold prices. Gold prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, and we aim to build a model that can capture these relationships to make accurate predictions. The project is implemented using Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment.

Dataset:
The dataset for this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains historical information about gold prices along with various relevant features. The dataset is preprocessed and prepared for analysis and model training.
